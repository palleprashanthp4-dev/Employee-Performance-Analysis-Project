##  ᴘʀᴏᴊᴇᴄᴛ ᴏᴠᴇʀᴠɪᴇᴡ

The **Employee Performance Analysis Project** explores and analyzes employee productivity data to understand **performance patterns, departmental efficiency, attendance impact, and productivity trends**.

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to evaluate employee task completion, working hours, performance ratings, and absence patterns. Through this analysis, the project identifies **key factors that influence employee performance** and highlights **top-performing employees and departments**.

The insights generated from this analysis help support **data-driven decision-making for workforce management and organizational productivity improvement**.
